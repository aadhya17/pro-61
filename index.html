        <p>
            my hobby is reading as Reading is important, and its value can’t be overestimated when it comes to children. It might easily help you develop your own way of thinking and point of view; it gives you endless knowledge on various topics (depending on what you like and choose) and broadens your horizons – all while keeping your mind active and you entertained. Reading helps you learn faster, sharpen your perception skills, understand the world and its people better – in short, reading can simply make you smarter. Not to mention that it significantly expands your vocabulary and hones your thinking skills, improving focus and concentration, as well as critical thinking.</p>
